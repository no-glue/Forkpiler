# Assignment 3

## Test Cases
1. The first test case makes sure that varlable length while loops work along 
with some of the more complicated if expressions. Both booleans and ints are
used a conditions along with math happening in conditions. Also nested ifs
and whiles are tested. The output should be: 11105556. Note that 1 represents
true and 0 represents false
2. The second test case tests parallel scopes along with math in print statements.
The output should be 81015.
